# Interview Questions
> Interview questions inspired by Mindorks - Android Interview Questions

## Disclaimer
> These are the questions I would ask in an interview.  
> I came up with some of them,  
> Some of them I heard from other people,  
> And some of them I came up on websites like StackOverflow (I will link to the original questions).  
> None of them are used by companies and covered by NDAs AFAIK. (ie. I didn't steal them from other interviews :))
